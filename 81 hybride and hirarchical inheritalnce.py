# Hybrid Inheritance in Python
# Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and single inheritance in object-oriented programming. It is a type of inheritance in which multiple inheritance is used to inherit the properties of multiple base classes into a single derived class, and single inheritance is used to inherit the properties of the derived class into a sub-derived class.

# In Python, hybrid inheritance can be implemented by creating a class hierarchy, in which a base class is inherited by multiple derived classes, and one of the derived classes is further inherited by a sub-derived class.

# Syntax
# The syntax for implementing Hybrid Inheritance in Python is the same as for implementing Single Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, or Hierarchical Inheritance.

# Here's the syntax for defining a hybrid inheritance class hierarchy:

class BaseClass1:
   pass
  # attributes and methods

class BaseClass2:
   pass
  # attributes and methods

class DerivedClass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2):
    pass
  # attributes and methods
# Example
# Consider the example of a Student class that inherits from the Person class, which in turn inherits from the Human class. The Student class also has a Program class that it is associated with.

class Human:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    
  def show_details(self):
    print("Name:", self.name)
    print("Age:", self.age)
    
class Person(Human):
  def __init__(self, name, age, address):
    Human.__init__(self, name, age)
    self.address = address
    
  def show_details(self):
    Human.show_details(self)
    print("Address:", self.address)
    
class Program:
  def __init__(self, program_name, duration):
    self.program_name = program_name
    self.duration = duration
    
  def show_details(self):
    print("Program Name:", self.program_name)
    print("Duration:", self.duration)
    
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, name, age, address, program):
    Person.__init__(self, name, age, address)
    self.program = program
    
  def show_details(self):
    Person.show_details(self)
    self.program.show_details()















# Hierarchical Inheritance
# Hierarchical Inheritance is a type of inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming where multiple subclasses inherit from a single base class. In other words, a single base class acts as a parent class for multiple subclasses. This is a way of establishing relationships between classes in a hierarchical manner.

# Here's an example to illustrate the concept of hierarchical inheritance in Python:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def show_details(self):
        print("Name:", self.name)

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        Animal.__init__(self, name)
        self.breed = breed

    def show_details(self):
        Animal.show_details(self)
        print("Species: Dog")
        print("Breed:", self.breed)

class Cat(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, color):
        Animal.__init__(self, name)
        self.color = color

    def show_details(self):
        Animal.show_details(self)
        print("Species: Cat")
        print("Color:", self.color)
